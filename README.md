# devBoardApp
A webapp in OOP Javascript + Bootstrap that lets you track and mark your issues and bugs during development.

## Specification (MVP)
- a premade project with an issues list

- practice single responsibility principle
- learn and implement the basics of bootstrap
- make the project as extensible as possible

## Project Roadmap
- create wireframe for the MVP
- setup webpack for modules
- create a simple todo in console log
- separate crud into modules
- separate dom modification from the logic
- create a front with bootstrap
