- create a workflow for this project:
	- webpack for the js
	- scss to sass
	- run tests (create a simple test case for this)
- automate the workflow via a script ideally with python
- create a pop up that asks for cookies and their acceptance
- look up how to replace local storage with firebase
- log in with firebase: how would it work?
